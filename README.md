## Educational Collective React TypeScript Project

This educational collective React TypeScript project is designed to enhance learning through the use of flashcards. The main functionality of this application is to provide a platform for users to create and manage their own flashcards, consisting of questions and corresponding answers.

### Technologies

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces with reusable components and efficient state management.

- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, improving code quality and catching potential bugs.

- **RTK Query:** A data fetching and caching library built on Redux Toolkit, simplifying API requests and data management.

- **Storybook:** A development environment for building, testing, and documenting UI components in isolation.

### Features

- **Flashcard Learning:** Users can create and manage their own flashcards, consisting of questions and corresponding answers.
- **Customizable Decks:** Users have the ability to create multiple decks to organize their flashcards based on different subjects or topics.
- **Spaced Repetition:** The app incorporates a spaced repetition algorithm to optimize the learning process. Flashcards that are correctly answered are shown less frequently, while those that are answered incorrectly appear more often, aiding in efficient memorization.
- **Progress Tracking:** Users can track their learning progress by monitoring the grade of flashcards studied.
- **Interactive Interface:** The app offers a user-friendly interface that facilitates easy navigation and interaction with the flashcards.
